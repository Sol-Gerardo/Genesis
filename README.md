# Genesis

- This project involves the development of my personal website.
- I will be developing everything from the backend to the front end myself.
- The backend is mostly set up. I am using an EC2 instance with the domain name https://gsoulis.blog.com.
- The EC2 instance uses a DNS server that I have configured using bind9, as well as an NGINX server. I have also used Certbot to enable HTTPS rather than HTTP.
- While I am developing the front end, the backend will be shut down to prevent accumulating the cost of uptime on the server.
- I will also be implementing Lambda functions to automate the server shutdown, which will occur daily from 12 PM PST to 7 AM PST to save costs.
---
- The site will feature all projects I have worked on that I have not yet posted or shared, as well as projects I am currently working on.
- Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your stay.
